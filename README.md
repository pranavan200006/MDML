Machine learning-based Malware Detection tool
### Malware has emerged as a major cyber hazard in the modern era due to the Internet's rapid expansion. Malware is any software that engages in malicious activities, such as data theft, espionage, etc. "A type of computer program designed to infect a legitimate user's computer and inflict harm on it in multiple ways" is what Kaspersky Labs (2017) defines as malware. ###
Anti-virus scanners are unable to keep up with the growing diversity of malware, leaving millions of hosts vulnerable to attacks. In 2015, 4,000,000 distinct malware items were found and 6,563,145 distinct sites were attacked, according to Kaspersky Labs (2016). Consequently, by 2019, the cost of data breaches is expected to exceed $2.1 trillion worldwide, according to Juniper Research (2016).
